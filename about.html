                            Our main performances are our official semester shows! These are hour-long shows full of our latest and greatest improv games. Each game gets a suggestion from you, our lovely audience, which becomes the basis of the scene! Throughout the year, our games become more varied as our troupe refines all our games and adds new ones to our repertoire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is easy to know when one of these shows is by looking at our socials. They are thoroughly marketed, so it is easy to know when they are coming soon. Shows are often themed in some way, encouraging our troupe and audience members to dress a certain way or participate in games a certain way. It is our goal to bring you exciting, varied, and always entertaining comedy routines that you will thoroughly enjoy.

                            Another way you can see us is at various events on Drake's campus! Invited by other organizations, we often perform at their events hosted by fellow student organizations. Whether it's an outdoor event, formal, informal, or a fundraiser event, we love to show up to help other organizations expand their reach. These sets are typically shorter with just a few shorter scenes, but contain just as much fun and give our members a chance to get some extra practice leading and performing games!

                            If you or your organization wants to have us at your event, reach out to us and we will try our best to find available members! We would love the chance to perform for new people and build connections to other organizations!

                            One of our biggest events of the year is our yearly auditions! Every year during the start of the fall semester, anyone interested in auditioning to join our troupe is invited to participate in auditions! It is an opportunity for those who have seen our shows or simply possess a love of performing comedy to join our troupe for the remainder of their college career. Auditions take multiple days to complete, with an initial round of auditions followed by a round of callbacks before we make our final decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our entire troupe thoroughly deliberates long and hard about who we think would fit best in our troupe. We are always thankful for anyone who takes the time to show interest in our organization. Keep an eye out on our socials at the start of the academic year to see when auditions will be!

These could be late-night open rehearsals, where we invite you to see what our rehearsals look like on any normal week, or taking a road trip to visit other college improv troupes to participate in their festivals.
